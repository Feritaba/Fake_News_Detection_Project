# Liar_Detection_Project

In this project I tried to find the latent features of the Liar dataset that is available publicly.

## how?
I applied the "doc2vec" algrithm to transform the statements column of the "train.tsv" file and created the "docvectors.txt" consists of 256 feature vectors for each statement.

## Results?
So far the results of this project is accessible via "Liar_Detection.ipynb" file. I'm still working on this project to find the best way to find the latent features of this dataset.
